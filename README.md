# Authentication Security Fundamentals

## Overview
This project is a Python-based educational lab focused on understanding authentication security concepts.

It demonstrates insecure and secure approaches to credential handling, password storage, and authentication logic in a controlled local environment.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand authentication fundamentals
- Learn the risks of insecure password storage
- Apply hashing and salting techniques
- Observe basic attack scenarios ethically
- Reflect on security and privacy responsibilities

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- JSON (initial insecure storage)
- Hashing libraries (bcrypt / hashlib)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Logging

---

## Scope & Ethics
This project is developed strictly for educational purposes.
All data is locally generated and contains no real credentials.
Attack simulations are controlled and performed only against the local system.

---

## Program Alignment
- Python Programming Bootcamp
- Introduction to Cyber Security
- Essentials of IT & Ethics
